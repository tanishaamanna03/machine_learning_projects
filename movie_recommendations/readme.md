<h1>Movie Recommendation Engine</h1>

This project is a machine learning movie recommendation model built with python, Flask, scikit-learn and pandas. The model uses collaborative filtering and TF-IDF vectorization to suggest movies based on user preferences and viewing patterns. Users can search for movies by title and receive personalized recommendations based on similar viewers' ratings. The recommendation algorithm identifies movies that were highly rated by users with similar tastes, providing a score that indicates the strength of each recommendation. The intuitive interface allows for easy navigation and discovery of new content, making it an ideal tool for movie enthusiasts looking to explore films beyond their usual preferences. This project demonstrates practical applications of machine learning techniques in creating personalized recommendation systems.
