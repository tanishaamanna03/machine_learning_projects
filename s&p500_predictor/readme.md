<h1>S&P 500 Stock Market Prediction with Random Forest Classifier</h1>
This project focuses on predicting the future direction of the S&P 500 index based on historical stock market data using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to forecast whether the market will close higher or lower the following day.

**Data Collection:** Utilizes the yfinance library to download historical stock data of the S&P 500 msrket index, including features like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Dividends, and Stock Splits.

**Model Building:** Implements a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn to model the relationship between historical market data and future stock price movements. Various technical indicators like rolling averages are also integrated to improve prediction accuracy.

**Backtesting:** Evaluates model performance using a rolling window approach, predicting market direction over multiple time horizons and providing insights into the modelâ€™s predictive power.

**Performance Metrics:** Measures precision to assess the effectiveness of the model, highlighting the model's ability to predict market trends with various configurations.

<h3>Packages Used:</h3>
- yfinance for stock data retrieval
- pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- scikit-learn for machine learning model training and evaluation
- matplotlib for visualizing predictions and model performance
